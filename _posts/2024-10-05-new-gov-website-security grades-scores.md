We added a new [ScanGov](https://scangov.org) indicator that grades/scores federal and state government websites based on basic web security practices.

## Why it matters &#128680;

Government agencies must incorporate application security throughout every phase of website and digital service design and development. The Office of Management and Budget [Memorandum M-22-09](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf) sets requirements for federal agencies to adhere to specific cybersecurity standards, aligning with the federal governmentâ€™s zero trust architecture strategy. This approach ensures a more secure and resilient digital infrastructure.

## What we monitor &#128994;

* [Content Security Policy](/content-security-policy)
* [HTTP Strict Transport Security](/https-hsts)
* [X-Content-Type-Options](/x-content-type-options)
* [security.txt](/security-text)

## Grades/scores &#129489;&#8205;&#127979;

- [Federal](): TBD / TBD%
- [States](): TBD / TBD%

## Sources &#128214;

We use these government and nonprofit sources for guidance:

* Cloud.gov
* Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
* Open Web Application Security Project
