## About

Ensure all interactive controls are accessible via keyboard navigation and display visible focus indicators. Use the `TAB` key to navigate through controls, and `ENTER` or `SPACE` to interact. If some controls are not focusable, add `tabindex="0"` to include them in the tab order. This practice benefits users who rely on keyboard navigation.
