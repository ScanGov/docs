## About

RFC 9116 sets rules for the "security.txt" file, which helps organizations share how to report security problems. This file, usually found at /.well-known/security.txt, makes it easier for security experts to report issues. It includes details like contact info, encryption keys, and policy links. The file can be digitally signed to ensure its authenticity. With this standard format, organizations can handle security reports more efficiently and respond to problems faster.
