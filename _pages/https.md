## Guidance

All government websites must have HTTPS.

OMB Memorandum M-15-1338 requires agencies to encrypt HTTP traffic that travels
over the public internet to or from a Federal system, using HTTPS and HTTP Strict Transport
Security (HSTS)

## About

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the strongest privacy and integrity protection currently available for public web connections. HTTPS ensures users that their privacy is protected when visiting a government website.

HTTPS is indicated by a lock icon and/or `https://` in the browser bar.

## Examples

Example government websites with HTTPS:

* <https://digital.gov>
* <https://whitehouse.gov>
