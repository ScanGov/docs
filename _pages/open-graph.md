## About

Open Graph is a protocol that helps websites control how their content look when shared on social media. It decides the title, image, and description that appear in previews. This makes shared links more attractive and informative. Platforms like Facebook and X use Open Graph to display content properly. Website owners add special tags to their pages to customize previews, helping posts stand out and get more clicks.
