## Guidance

Core Web Vitals assessment grades cumulative layout shift as "good" when the page is making less than or equal to 0.1 seconds of unexpected shifts.

## About

Cumulative layout shift measures how much a page unexpectedly moves things around once they are displayed.

Regular interactions that change content like clicking a button are expected shifts and are not counted in the layout shift.
