## About

The General Services Administration Site Scanning program automatically checks public federal websites to assess their health, policy compliance, and best practices. It maintains a Federal Website Index, listing all public federal .gov sites by agency or department. Daily scans generate extensive data on approximately 26,000 federal .gov websites, which are publicly available via API and bulk download. The program scans for various factors, including the presence of agency websites and subdomains, participation in the Digital Analytics Program, use of the US Web Design System, search engine optimization, third-party services, IPv6 compliance, and other best practices.
