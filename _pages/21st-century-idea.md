## About

The 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA), enacted in December 2018, mandates that U.S. federal agencies modernize their websites, digitize services and forms, adopt e-signatures, enhance customer experience, and standardize shared services. In September 2023, the Office of Management and Budget issued Memo M-23-22 to further guide agencies in implementing these requirements, aiming to provide a digital-first public experience that meets modern expectations.
