## About

Web Vitals are Google's metrics for assessing website user experience. Core Web Vitals focus on loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability. These include Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). Other Web Vitals are Time to First Byte (TTFB) and First Contentful Paint (FCP).
