## Guidance

All government websites must have a `.gov` / `.edu` / `.mil` sponsored top-level domain.

## About

Generic top-level domains (gTLD) (`.com`, `.org`, etc.) are non-country extensions that indicate the purpose or source of the website.

sTLDs (`.gov` / `.edu` / `.mil`) are a subgroup of gTLDs managed by designated organizations and restricted to specific registrant types.

A `.gov` / `.edu` / `.mil` extension verifies that the website is managed by a United States government organization (federal, state, local). Government non-.gov gTLDs can potentially confuse users and create opportunities for non-government entities to spoof official government services. Adopting the `.gov` / `.edu` / `.mil` extension ensures users are visiting an official government website.

## Examples

Example of government websites with a `.gov` sTLD:

* [digital.gov](https://digital.gov)
* [whitehouse.gov](https://whitehouse.gov)
