## About

The Department of Justice issued a rule ("Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability; Accessibility of Web Information and Services of State and Local Government Entities") requiring state and local governments to make their websites and mobile apps accessible to people with disabilities (WCAG 2.1, Level AA). This rule, effective April 24, 2024, specifies technical standards to ensure equal access to online services. Governments have until April 2026 or April 2027, depending on their size, to comply.
