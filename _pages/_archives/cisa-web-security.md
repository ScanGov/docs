## About

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warns that cyberattacks can damage websites by defacing them, stealing data, or making them unusable. These attacks harm security, trust, and finances. To stay safe, organizations should protect their domain systems, check DNS and registrar records, and change default passwords. Following these steps helps keep websites secure from hackers.
