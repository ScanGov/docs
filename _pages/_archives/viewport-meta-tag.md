## About

The viewport meta tag helps web pages look good on all devices by controlling the screen size and zoom settings. This makes websites adjust to fit different screens. You can also disable zooming or set a custom zoom level. Itâ€™s important for making websites mobile-friendly.

## Example

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
