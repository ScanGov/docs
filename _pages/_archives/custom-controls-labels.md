## About

Custom interactive controls, like buttons or checkboxes, need clear labels so everyone, including users with disabilities, can understand their purpose. For example, if you create a custom button using a `<div>`, adding a label helps screen readers describe it properly. Using standard HTML elements like `<button>` is best, but if you use custom elements, ensure they are labeled clearly and can be accessed with a keyboard.
