## About

Canonicalization ensures that search engines index the correct version of a page when there are duplicate or similar pages. By specifying a canonical URL with the `rel="canonical"` tag, you direct search engines to the primary page, helping improve SEO. This prevents search engines from splitting the ranking between multiple pages with similar content. Proper canonicalization avoids indexing issues and boosts a site's performance in search results.
