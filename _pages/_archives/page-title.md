## About

The HTML `<title>` tag sets the title of a webpage, which appears in the browser tab and search results. It helps users know what the page is about and improves search engine optimization. The `<title>` tag goes inside the `<head>` section of an HTML document. A good title is short, clear, and relevant to the page content.

## Code

```html
<head>
  <title>Our website</title>
</head>
```
