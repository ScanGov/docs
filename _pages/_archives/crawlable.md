## About

The `robots.txt` file tells AI crawlers and search engines which parts of a website they can or cannot access. This helps website owners control what data is available to AI models while protecting private or sensitive information. It also prevents unnecessary crawling, reducing server load and improving site performance. By following `robots.txt` rules, AI crawlers respect website preferences and ensure ethical data collection.
