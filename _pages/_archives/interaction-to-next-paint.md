## About

Interaction to Next Paint (INP) measures how quickly a webpage responds to user actions like clicks or typing. It tracks the time from when you interact until the next screen update. A good INP score is 200 milliseconds or less, ensuring a smooth experience. INP has replaced First Input Delay (FID) as a key performance metric.
