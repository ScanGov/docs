Content legibility can be improved by passing the following audits:

1. Background and foreground colors have a sufficient contrast ratio: Low-contrast text is difficult or impossible for many users to read.

1. Links are distinguishable without relying on color: Low-contrast text is difficult or impossible for many users to read. Link text that is discernible improves the experience for users with low vision.
