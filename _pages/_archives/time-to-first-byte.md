## About

Time to First Byte (TTFB) measures the time it takes from when a browser requests a resource to when the first byte of data begins to load. It's an important metric for website performance, affecting how quickly a page appears. A good TTFB is under 0.8 seconds, and anything over 1.8 seconds needs improvement. TTFB is influenced by server responsiveness and connection setup time. Lowering it can improve overall user experience and speed.
