## About

HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` serve as landmarks, helping screen readers and assistive technologies identify and navigate different sections of a webpage. Incorporating these landmarks enhances accessibility by allowing users to quickly jump to desired content areas. To implement, wrap major sections of your page with appropriate landmark elements.
