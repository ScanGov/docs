## About

Readability refers to how easy it is for a reader to understand written text. It depends on factors like word choice, sentence length, and presentation. Readability is important for many types of writing, including newspapers, technical documents, and books. Various formulas, such as Flesch-Kincaid and Gunning Fog, are used to measure readability. Writers adjust readability to match their target audienceâ€™s understanding, often aiming for a level around the 8th grade for general readability.
