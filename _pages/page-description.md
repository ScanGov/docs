## About

A page description is a short summary of a webpage, usually shown in search results. Itâ€™s set using the `<meta name="description">` tag inside the `<head>` section of an HTML document. A good description is clear, brief, and tells users what to expect on the page. It also helps with search engine optimization. 

## Code

```html
<head>
  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to our website">
</head>
```
