## About

First Contentful Paint (FCP) measures how quickly a webpage shows any content after a user starts to load it. It checks the time from when the user begins to navigate to the page until any part of the page's content, like text or images, appears on the screen. A fast FCP reassures users that the page is loading. For a good user experience, aim for an FCP of 1.8 seconds or less.
