## About

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of rules for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities. WCAG helps developers, designers, and others create websites that are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. These guidelines have different levels (A, AA, and AAA), with AAA being the highest. Following WCAG helps make the web more user-friendly for everyone.
