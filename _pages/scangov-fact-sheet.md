## How it started

ScanGov started as a father-son civic hacking project (now [Project ScanGov](https://scangov.org)) in January 2024.

The project initially scanned federal and state government website homepages and graded these based on certain technical criteria:

- [Metadata](/metadata)
- [URL structure](/domain)
- [Security](/security)
