## About

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures how long it takes for the main content of a web page to appear. This is important because it helps users know when the page is ready. A good LCP time is 2.5 seconds or less. It tracks the largest visible element, like images, videos, or text blocks. A faster LCP improves user experience and helps websites perform better.
