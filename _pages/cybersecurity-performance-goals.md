## About

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) are voluntary practices that help organizations defend against cyber threats. These goals are divided into five key areas: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. They include proactive steps like tracking assets and fixing vulnerabilities, as well as reactive actions like reporting incidents and planning for recovery. By following these guidelines, organizations can lower their risk of cyberattacks and strengthen the nationâ€™s cybersecurity.
